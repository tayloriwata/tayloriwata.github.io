<p> For the Invoice WOD we needed to create a sales receipt for five different products. Some of the tasks that we needed to complete consisted of listing the quantity, price, extended price, sub-total, and tax. In this receipt that we formatted to a table, we also had to make sure that each section was calculated and formatted properly. </p>

<p><a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">Here is a link to the Invoice WOD </a> </p>

<p> While doing the WOD, I had the most trouble remembering to put the calculations for the sub-totals, tax, etc. I kept forgetting how to format the code so that it calculates properly. I also kept having minor mistakes, like forgetting to put semicolons and using the toFixed command properly to get rid of the extra decimals. For me, I usually forget the steps when the WODs are a bit longer. I eventually ended up having to scroll through the html in order to find out what I did wrong which led me to go past the RX times. </p>

<p> To prepare for the WODs, I usually end up remembering the steps which allowed me to finish the WOD within the RX time. But in order for me to remember this efficiently, I like to first understand everything I'm doing. For example, I want to know what each command or code that I write does so that I understand why I have to write it. Doing it this way for me is the easiest way for me to memorize the steps. Although it took me six attempts which were the most attempts it took me to finish a WOD before, I felt like I understood this WOD the best and will most likely be able to do similar coding tasks if they are like this WOD. </p>

<p> I think next time I can try to go through the readings more, I realized after I finished the WOD that there was a lot of useful information that I missed throughout the reading. Instead of only trying to memorize the steps I could look more into it so I can understand everything easier. </p>
