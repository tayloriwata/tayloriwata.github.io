I decided to choose Management Information Systems as my major because of an Uncle of mines who works in the cybersecurity field. He initially introduced me to a counselor at Kapiolani Community College who he had known for quite some time. After meeting with her and discussing my sudden interest in computers, she suggested that I should major in MIS. Growing up I had always used computers and played games on them, so seeing that the future is going to be really technologcally advanced was a big part in choosing MIS as my major. I didn't really have interests towards any other majors, so that's why I decided to give it a try.
