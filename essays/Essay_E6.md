**1.	Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)**

My store is a sneaker store. The catch is that I tried to put some of the most expensive and High-end sneakers on the market. In the beginning, I only had Nike products but with the requirements of needing 2 more separate pages which a combined total of 3 product pages, I added brands like Converse and Adidas.

**2.	Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?**

One of the features that doesnt work is the function where after you logged in, it would display a logout button instead of log in. I couldnt figure out how to make it so that I can log out after logging in.

**3.	Describe what you are most proud of about your system:**

I am the most proud of being able to finish on time and completing the shopping cart function. I had a lot of trouble making my cart function work in the beginning, I ended up modifying the example cart that the professor provided and was able to change the code to make it work on my website.

**4.	Describe what you are least happy with your system:**

I’m least happy with the logout feature that I previously mentioned. I am also disappointed in myself for not designing the website itself to make it look professional. I think I should have spent a little more time designing and making everything look nice.

**5.	How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?**

Assignment 2 was different from assignment 3 because I had to make sure after adding the shopping cart feature that everything else works. I had to try and fix it so that everything would work at the same time.

**6.	When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?**

When I ran into a problem, I tried to find other solutions until I found something that worked for me. I had to do a lot of research every time I ran into something since I wasn’t good at coming up with solutions by myself. I searched my exact problem on google and then tried to go from there.

**7.	Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?**

I think the shopping cart worked well and was easy since the professor went over it a bit on the last day of class. It was easy to learn how sessions worked and the workshop class made it even easier to follow along.

**8.	Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?**

It was hard for me to get the cookies to work with this assignment, I couldn’t figure out exactly how to do it. I tried to first look at the labs but got even more confused, I also tried looking it up but still ran into problems. The cookies function definitely caused the most headaches for me.

**9.	What did you learn from doing this assignment?**

I learned how to store things in the session. For example, the cart function allowed me to store my products in the session and made it so that I can select products from different pages.

**10.	If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?**

Something I would change is the layout of my website and code. I found myself lost in my own code since I everything would be all over the place. Instead, I should have organized everything by category and grouped all the similar things together. 

**11.	Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging**

a. 30%, b. 50%, c. 20%

**12.	Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)**

I did not have a partner for this Assignment.
