<h1>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: </h1>
	The biggest way my programming skills have improved is how I read and interpret code. This is by far the biggest improvement because I still remember when we first started this class and I wasn’t sure how to read code and was often getting confused. Nowadays after completing the WOD’s and Assignment 1, it is easier for me to understand how to write code properly and why I need to write it.
<h1>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h1>
	I still think I need to work on all my programming skills because I am not even close to being perfect. My biggest concern going forward would be to work on understanding instructions without help. What I mean by this is that before I write code I often find myself having to research or looking things up. This isn’t that big of a problem since the professor said it's normal but, I think I need to understand the concepts of the code that I’m looking up better.
<h1>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h1>
	At the beginning of this class, I definitely couldn’t do the WOD’s without the screencast but leading up to the last 3 WOD’s I found myself starting to understand what needed to be done and writing the correct code after reading the instructions. The only thing that was challenging was fully grasping the concept of why I needed to write the code that I wrote down. That was the best way that the screencasts helped me, it explained the “why” of the code I was writing.
<h1>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h1>
	I think the labs played a big role in expanding my knowledge on programming. I think that the professor is really good at explaining the labs to the class. Most of the time nowadays he tells us to do most of the lab on our own, and I have felt pretty confident knowing what to do most of the time. Sometimes I have to re-watch lectures or research for code but for the most part I think that I was able to improve tremendously from the start.
<h1>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h1>
	After completing Assignment 1 I think it was a good test to see how much I improved and made sure to test if I can use what I learned throughout the semester so far to complete it. I struggled a bit with properly making code that I used to give the error messages when purchasing items. But in the end, I just needed to research a bit more and re-watch the screencasts from previous labs. After experiencing what Assignment 1 was like, I’m confident that I will be able to do good on Assignment 2.
<h1>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h1>
	I think that the class can be improved if the professor went over the lecture screencasts on each module. I find it hard to get good grades on the Laulima quizzes, even after watching the screencasts and reading the notes. Other than that I think that the class is well informative in teaching the programming aspect.
<h1>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h1>
	I think that the WOD’s, screencasts, and Labs are the most important things in this class. They are really informative and helped give me the correct information and help in order to complete things on my own, like Assignment 1. They do a really good job at explaining the concepts of the code that we write.
