On the first WOD I had a lot of trouble figuring out on my own how to do everthing while following the instructions. I ended up finishing the BrowserHisotry 1 in about na hour and 10 minutes. I then tried to watch the screen cast while doing it which reduced my time by about 20 mins, but I kept getting confused on how to format the code and where to put it. It ended up taking me 5 whole attempts to finish it within the RX time. I think a major part that helped me was memorizing and remebering shortcuts to make the coding process shorter. Ovrtime I started to read the instructions, than I realized that I was remebering the commands without having to look them up or watch the screencast for them.

During the second WOD, I found this the easiest because I was more comfortable doing code in the style.css. It onlt took me 3 tries and I ended up finishing within 4 minutes. The last WOD wasn't that hard either and only took me around 7 minutes, this one wasn\t that hard other than figuring out the style.css on my own. There were fewer instructions so that's why I struggled a little bit. But after finishing it a couple times I started to get used to the code required to format the document.
