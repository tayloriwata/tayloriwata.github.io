<strong>Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should be clear.</strong><br>
Click <a href="https://youtu.be/fpXMo9w6srk">here</a> to view my video explaining how my website will work.

<strong>Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.</strong><br>
My shopping cart will be a separate page. Users will be able to add products from any products page into this cart. The users will also be able to remove the items if they wish to. 

<strong>Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.</strong><br>
I plan to add the prodcuts into the session data as an object key. I will use the quantities of the product and put it into an array format, this will be the value for each product key. { Jordan 1: [ 2, 0, 1 ], Converse Classic Chuck: [ 1, 0, 1 ] }

<strong>How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?</strong><br>
If the user tries to purchase without logging in, it will not let them add the products to the cart. i also can can use cookies to check if the session user has alreayd been on the site.

<strong>Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)</strong><br>
When a user is logged in, it will have their email on the top right so they know that they are logged in.

<strong>If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?</strong><br>
I am not working with a partner.

<strong>How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?</strong><br>
I am approaching Assignment 3 differently this time by making sure I start and finish early, so that if I run into any problems I can get help beore it's too late. This way I can not be so stressed out and focus on mamking my website look nice, work efficiently, and have more time to work on other assignment for my other classes.
