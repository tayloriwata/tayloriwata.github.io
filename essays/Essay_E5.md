<strong>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</strong><br>
In Assignment2 our task was to make a login page that popped up after the user pressed purchase on the products page. We had to make sure that the user was able to create an account and then make sure that if that user came back, their username and password would still work. Some other tasks included designing the login page and also making an option to edit the information. Here is the link to the instructions if you want to learn more: <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html">Assignment 2</a>.

<strong>What did you learn from this assignment?</strong><br>
 After completing this assignment I think the main thing that we learned was debugging. This was a big help in making sure that we don’t have to go through each line of code individually to find mistakes. In class, the professor taught us how to efficiently debug our own code which helped me a lot on Assignment2.

<strong>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</strong><br>
I did not work with a partner, but the total time I spent working on the assignment was around 6 days.

<strong>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</strong><br>
I got help from rewwatching class recordings and going over the labs again since they had some examples that helped with Assignment2. I mostly needed help with figuring out the correct code to make the registration info go into the user_data.json file.

<strong>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</strong><br>
I think this assignment wasn’t as hard as completing assignment1 because assignment1 took longer since we were pretty much starting from scratch. Even though we kinda make a products store before in the labs it was still hard to make it look better and more professional. In Assignment2 we just had to add a few more codes and make a login/registration page which I didn’t find to be too hard compared to all the code we had to do in Asssignment1.

<strong>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</strong><br>
 If I were to guess I would say that it probably took me around 20% to think of how to plan my code and where to put it, 60% of the time was spent writing the code, and the other 20% was spent debugging and testing. 

<strong>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</strong><br>
I thought that it was much easier for me to design my login page this time, since it took me a while to find a nice home page for Assignment1. I was having a few problems with writing the proper code to make my registration page send data to the user_data file but other than that I didn't think it was too bad. 

<strong>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</strong><br>
If I can go back in time I think I would have palnned out my cod on the very first days that the assignment was introduced so that I can make time for me to get hlep from the professor. This would of allowed me to make my assignment look a lot better and have better formatted code.
